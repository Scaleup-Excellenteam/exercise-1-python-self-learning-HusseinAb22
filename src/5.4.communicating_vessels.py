def interleave(*iterables):
    """
    Takes multiple iterables and returns a list of their elements interleaved in round-robin order.

    Iterables that are exhausted are skipped in the next rounds.

    A generator version of `interleave` that yields elements in round-robin order from multiple iterables.

    Once an iterable is exhausted, itâ€™s skipped in future rounds.
    Useful for memory-efficient iteration.
